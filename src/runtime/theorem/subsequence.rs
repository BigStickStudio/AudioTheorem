// Disposition is a Music Theory concept that is used to determine the color of the note (later might add a fractional degree or mixing of colors as a vector) << -- we are incorporating this through pitchgroups and scales
// The intent and purpose of this system, alongside the sequence Data, is to interface the pitchgroups and scales with the audio and graphics systems to help correlate
// the color of the notes with the sound and the key of the music. This is a proprietary system that is being developed for the Ancillary via Big Stick Studios, and is not to be used without permission.

/*  Proposed Questions 
    - can we use audio structure as an indicator for an AI system to learn to analyze speech patterns, emotion, phonetics, and intent?
    - Is there a correlation to audio and emotion?
    - Can we prove that life comes from Oxygon and Hydrogen when met with Carbon and Nitrogen?
    - Will I make my first million before I'm 35?
